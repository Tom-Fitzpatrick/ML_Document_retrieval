Entry) BSc (Hons) At Keele, studying a combined honours degree will include some modules from both of the single honours degrees. In this case, your programme will be made up of a combination of modules from both Astrophysics and Computer Science. Combined Honours Combined Honours degrees allow you to study two different subjects in one degree. Find out more about Combined Honours degrees. Study abroad Learn a language International year 3 years/ 4 years with international year UCAS code: FG54 View entry requirements Course Overview School links: School of Chemical and Physical Sciences School of Computing and Mathematics In Astrophysics, you will learn to formulate and tackle problems – from below the level of the atomic nucleus to astronomical scales. Astrophysics is active wherever the laws of physics are being tested to the limit – and beyond. Keele will help you to use astronomical observations, mathematical models and computer simulation to develop theories explaining some of the most complex phenomena. You’ll develop your mathematics and computing skills, and apply them to solving a range of problems in the laboratory and beyond (you’ll have access to Keele’s own on-site observatory). We operate an open-door policy, which enables you to have excellent and flexible access to staff to seek advice or feedback on their work. This course is enriched by our research interests and international collaborative research programmes. This combined course is accredited by the Institute of Physics. Alongside this you will be studying Computer Science and at Keele, you’ll learn the underpinning theories of software, hardware and computing techniques – and how to apply them in the real world. You’ll learn to use technology to create new opportunities and to solve a wide range of problems, benefiting every aspect of society from the home to business, government and beyond. This means your skills are likely to be in high demand when you graduate. Our teaching is informed by our cutting-edge research, and we also reflect what’s happening now in industry. Combined honours students can follow a set of modules providing a specialism in information systems, evolutionary systems, or creative computing, whilst single honours students cover all these strands. There’s a strong emphasis on programming – but don’t worry if you don’t have Maths A-level, because the course covers what you need to know. You’ll have 24/7 access to our own computing labs, based on Microsoft Windows and Linux, plus a wide range of software. What will this mean for my future? Keele enjoys high rates of graduate employment, where in 2016, were recognised nationally as 1st for employability in the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education survey. An Astrophysics degree from Keele will prepare you for many different careers, which need not be directly related to astrophysics. You could take up all sorts of roles in industry, management, and public services, including teaching, health and finance. Many employers recognise that the versatility and flexibility of astrophysics means that graduates possess a wide range of very valuable skills, from independent and critical thinking to the solving of sophisticated problems. After studying computer science, the degree builds the essential skills which are in demand from employers looking for systems analysts, software engineers and consultants. You’ll graduate with a wide range of computing skills plus a highly developed approach to problem solving. Recent Keele graduates have gone to work for companies as diverse as Apple, BAE Systems, Barclays, Capgemini, EA Games, Experian, Microsoft and the Ministry of Defence. You’ll also have the solid grounding you’ll need to apply for postgraduate study.
